Justification {
	Ro 3 and 4
	- Justification: Abraham before circumcision, before Isaac, before the Law
	- Our justification before God centered on Abraham.

	Jas 2:10
	- Keep the whole law and stumble, guilty of all
	- Justification: Abraham justified by works
	- What kind of faith saves.
	- Wisdom literature, mouth tongue and how we speak
	- 2:14
	- Faith without works; profession without works does not save.
	- various types of faith
	- Need to mean it, be real; profession is one thing but if nothing follows it, it is not real.
	- Dead vs Living Faith
	
	- No contradiction; Different convos
	- Paul:
	- Jas: justified by works taking Isaac to altar, not works of the Law. Also justified in greek different meaning.
	- Wisdom is justified by her children. Godly wisdom produces 
}

If church doesnt have statement, a belief, that says
"true faith is always accompanied by works", they dont understand the gospel.
- All confessions agree that something fundamentally changes within us.
- If there is no works, then no true living faith to begin with.
- Eph 2:8-9
- Eph 2:10 we are His workmanship created in Christ JEsus to do good works.
evil one will take enough truth, twist it, and serve you to poison you.

Saved by GRACE [alone] thru FAITH {
	What does it mean?
	- God saved mankind not because we deserved it but because He loves us
	How do we receive it?
	- Thru faith and obedience 
	- water baptism to be united with Christ and receive forgiveness of sins
}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GRACE
- A power to live right (Titus 2:11-12)
- You can't earn it, Grace is a GIFT (Eph 2:8)
	Something you receive, you cant work for it
	Youre already enough in His eyes because of grace, no need to prove yourself 
- Covers your past, but doesn't leave you there (2Co 5:17)
	takes you from brokenness to wholeness 
	and leads you toward purpose
- Will never run out - no matter how many times you fall (Ro 5:20)
- Doesn't condemn, it elevates you (Ro 8:1)
	not defined by your mistakes
- Not just for you, but for those around you too (Eph 4:32)\
	causes to change you and those you encounter
- Reveals truth (Jn 1:17)
	empowers you to live according to God's standards
	shows you the fullness of God's truth and helps you walk it out
Embrace Grace Live free (2Co 12:9)
	Not simply something you receive but something that transfroms you 
	Trust in His grace and let Him carry you to freedom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FAITH

Gal 2:20-21 NIV {
	~~~~ Context v19 ~~~~
	For through the law I died to the law
	so that I might live for God.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I have been crucified with Christ
	and I no longer live,
	but Christ lives in me.
	
	The life I now live in the body,
	I live by faith in the Son of God,
	who loved me and gave himself for me
	NKJV {
		I have been crucified with Christ;
		it is no longer I who live,
		but Christ lives in me;
		~~~~~~~~~~~~
		and the life which I now live in the flesh
		I live by faith in the Son of God,
		who loved me and gave Himself for me.
	}
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I do not set aside the Grace of God,
	for if righteousness could be gained through the Law,
	Christ died for nothing
}

Faith is the root
good works are the fruit;
BUT good works are NOT what saves us {
	Faith in Jesus
	- Trusting in Him
	- parachute that saves You
	- adding anything else takes away what Jesus did to save you.
	////
	Jas 2
	- affirms faith alone
	- Abraham righteous simply by believing
	Ro 4:21
	- Abraham was fully convinced God will do what He said HE will do
	- same for us in Jesus
	Jas 2:24
	- justification before people, not proving to God anything
	- good faith will show good works
	- Ex/ vegans. if they beieve eating meat is wrong, it will show by their works in their diet. If they continue to eat meat, their belief, their faith, is a lie, but if they change their diet, their belief, their faith, is true.
	////
	Faith alone: 
	- 2Ti 1:9
	- Ro 4:5
	- Ro 11:6

[Gal 2, Acts 15, Amos 9]

ACTS 15 (same discussion, salvation thru grace vs works)
- Faith thru abrahma
- Jesus sacrifice,

~~~~~~ Acts 14 context ~~~~~~~~
	1 Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews,
	and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed. 
	2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren. 
	
	3 Therefore they stayed there a long time, 
	speaking boldly in the Lord, 
	who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, 
	granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
	
	4 But the multitude of the city was divided: 
		part sided with the Jews, 
		and part with the apostles. 
	5 And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, 
		to abuse
		and stone them, 
	6 they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region. 
	7 And they were preaching the gospel there.
	
	Idolatry at Lystra
	8 And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, 
	a cripple from his mother’s womb, 
	who had never walked. 
	9 This man heard Paul speaking. 
		Paul, observing him intently 
		and seeing that he had faith to be healed, 
		10 said with a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” 
		And he leaped and walked. 
	11 Now when the people saw what Paul had done, 
	they raised their voices, 
	saying in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” 
	12 And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. 
	
	13 Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, 
	brought oxen and garlands to the gates, 
	intending to sacrifice with the multitudes.
	14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, 
		they tore their clothes 
		and ran in among the multitude, crying out 
		15 and saying, 
		“Men, why are you doing these things? 
		We also are men with the same nature as you, 
		and preach to you that you should turn from these useless things to the living God, 
		who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them, 
		16 who in bygone generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways. 
		17 Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, 
		in that He did good, 
		gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, 
		filling our hearts with food and gladness.” 
	18 And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.
	
	Stoning, Escape to Derbe
	19 Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there;
	and having persuaded the multitudes, 
		they stoned Paul 
		and dragged him out of the city, 
		supposing him to be dead. 
	20 However, when the disciples gathered around him, 
		he rose up 
		and went into the city. 
		And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
	Strengthening the Converts
	21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, 
	they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, 
		22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, 
		exhorting them to continue in the faith, 
		and saying, 
		“We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.” 
	23 So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, 
		they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed. 
	24 And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 
	25 Now when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
	26 From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.
	27 Now when they had come and gathered the church together, 
		they reported all that God had done with them, 
		and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. 
	28 So they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
